# 🏦 Banking System Using OOP in C++

This project is a fully featured **console-based banking system** implemented in C++, redesigned from a simpler client management app :👉 **[BankWithCPP](https://github.com/KarimaFathi/BankWithCPP)**. It uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and scalability, and introduces several advanced banking features such as user management, permissions, transaction tracking, and currency exchange.
